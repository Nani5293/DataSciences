dot product of vectors : 
	* A.B = a.b.cos@
	* if @ =0, A.B = ab
	* if @ =90, A.B = 0
	
2 vectors are othogonal, A.B = 0, If magnitude = 1, they are orthonormal .

* Constant multiplication to vector is only stretching.
* Matrix multiplication to vector is stretching and rotating and skewing.


     A . Vector  = lambda . vector 

Here A is strtching only .
