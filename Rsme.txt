- Statistics : 
Mean, variance, degrees of freedom 
Population, Sample 
Random Variable Probability Distributions 
	- Normal (Z)
	- T (t)       - Means 
	- F ()
	- Chi square ()  - Variances 
	
pnorm(sample mean, null hypo on population mean , sample variances )
		- Gives Cumulative probability of sample mean with given pop mean and variance 
qnorm(probabaility of sample mean, null hypo on population mean, sample variance )
		- Given sample mean for given cumulative probabaility with pop mean and variance 
dnorm(sample mean, null hypo on pop mean , sample variance )
	- Gives the probability for a sample mean with given pop mean and variance.
