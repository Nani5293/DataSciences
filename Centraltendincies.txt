-- Central values : 
   Mean : Avg datpoint of all points . With outlyers Mean is pulled away
   Mode : Most repeated datapoint
   Median : Middle data point when put in ascending .
  
-- Variance :
  Summation of How far each datapoint is away from the mean ie., Diff of each point from mean / degrees of freedom : (dp-mean)sqre/n-1

-- Degrees of freedom : For multiple samples to have same mean, we take n-1 random samples and 1 intentional data point to keep the mean same. 
   This n-1 random samples are to be studied
  
-- Covariance : 
   With changes in X how Y values are varying . 
   ie., X and Y increasing 
        X+  Y- : Diff is positive 
		X-  Y+ : Diff is -ve 
		
-- CLT : Any random sample mean will be in a normal distribution of " Means of random samples "
   Thus, Any random sample mean can be predicted its probability being the population mean, as Sample means are always in a normal distribution 

So, Null hypothesis will be sample mean lies in 95% confidence region. 
	Now we Caluculate probability by considering the sample mean.
