** Residual Plots ** 

Means of residuals should be 0 
Residuals should not have any corrrelation 
Residuals should be in a normal dist


** 

QQ- residuals are Normal not
Influential outlyers - Out side cooks D 1 
0.5 -1 : Questionable points > If differ , why is special .
<0.5 : Acceptable


** 

1 variable - 1 slope = Basic Model
Deal with all slopes = Model 

*** 
Null Hypothesis :
Model has no effect on predictor variable :
No corelation : slope = 0
